In the rev1 boards I got MOSI/MISO pins backwards to the Gyro and the Barometer (mainly because they renamed them SDI/SDO for political correctness)

So, to fix them I used a NF.V2 Grinding Pen to cut the traces
(probably overkill, as I could have probably just used a snap away razor knife to cut the traces, eg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozH2F3AX8BY)

I suppose the grinding pen can get middle layer traces also if you are delicate

Anyway, looking at the small size of these traces I think soldering to them would be pretty difficult, so I think between copper tape and conductive ink pen I can connect them more easily. Although the pen is kind of pricey at $60 and has a short shelf life of 18 months. (Bought this one: CW2200MTP)

In summary: I ordered five rev1 boards, two have SMD component soldered up and work. (Not all components were pick and placed) Board one I shorted the voltage regulator, but can still be used for testing the Analog video OCD chip I believe. The next two boards had the SMD components soldered and work, and that leaves two untouched boards.

Probably would have been faster to just order more boards with the trace fixed in software and worked with JLCPCB to get all the SMD components connected from factory. But I want Rev2 to be perfect or near perfect so the more I can test on rev1 the better.

(That said I made rev1 in about a week while taking time off work when I had a wisdom tooth removed and probably should have reviewed the schematic more intensely prior to getting it made)

Added solder pen to the board for the SPI flip on the gyro only for now. Passes basic conductivity checks with a multimeter. Got really close to the vias but I lucked out, almost seems like a slight edge there preventing accidental bridging which is nice
