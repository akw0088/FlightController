Made by JLCPCB, for some reason some passive components weren't populated by their "engineer review", will manually add those. As well as the max chip (could have added it as a chinese copy AT7456, but it wasn't showing up under the part number I was using)

Also, they didn't have the Texas Instruments LDO in stock, so manually adding that one


DFU mode works
SWD works (debugging)
USB in non-DFU mode works (seems to be intermittent, but could be my bad soldering)

USB_DETECT pin does not match what the MCU expects
	MCU Wants PA9, but we are using PB2 -- Has to do with being 5v tolerant
SDCard works
	SPI3 bus and CS, using MCU provided middleware FATFS and some SPI internet hacks someone posted

	Check out if Gyro works
	Check out if Baro works

	SPI Communication between the BMP280 BMI270 and MAX OSD chip will not work on this revision
		Accidentally connected SDI to SDI and SDO to SDO
		Should connect SDI to SDO and SDO to SDI
		Similar to RX to TX and TX to RX on a UART

	Got lucky with the SD Card, because they didn't call their PINS SDI/SDO in the schematic


TODO:
	Determine why betaflight doesnt come up
		Clocking issue? --  we have 8mhz HSE (external clock)

	Maybe check each UART out?
	nothing on i2c, so nothing needed there, could get an external SPI sensor and plug in if pins accessible someplace (might need a pullup or similar)

			
To fix in Rev2:
	Use PA9 for USB Detect, not PB2
	Ensure Tag connect pinout matches what the adapters expect (so 0.1" header jumpers are not needed)
	Connect SDI/SDO correctly on Gyro, Baro, and MAX OSD Chip
	Resolve betaflight boot issue with generic STM32F7 firmware
