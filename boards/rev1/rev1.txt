Made by JLCPCB, for some reason some passive components weren't populated by their "engineer review", will manually add those. As well as the max chip (could have added it as a chinese copy AT7456, but it wasn't showing up under the part number I was using)

Also, they didn't have the Texas Instruments LDO in stock, so manually adding that one


DFU mode works
SWD works (debugging)
USB in non-DFU mode works (seems to be intermittent, but could be my bad soldering)

USB_DETECT pin does not match what the MCU expects
	MCU Wants PA9, but we are using PB2 -- Has to do with being 5v tolerant
SDCard works
	SPI3 bus and CS, using MCU provided middleware FATFS and some SPI internet hacks someone posted

TODO:
	Check out if Gyro works
	Check out if Baro works
	Maybe check each UART out?
	nothing on i2c, so nothing needed there
	Determine why betaflight doesnt come up
		Clocking issue? --  we have 8mhz HSE (external clock)
